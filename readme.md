# K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and Regressor Project

## Description

This project involves the implementation and evaluation of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. The KNN algorithm is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning method used widely in various machine learning applications. In this project, we apply KNN to different datasets, analyze its performance, and compare it to other machine learning models.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. Install the necessary dependencies by executing:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies

The required Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
These libraries are essential for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

## Data Overview
The project utilizes two datasets to demonstrate the application of KNN in classification and regression:

1. `Classification Dataset`: This dataset contains labeled instances for training the KNN classifier.
2. `Regression Dataset`: This dataset includes continuous output values for training the KNN regressor.
Both datasets are preprocessed to address missing values, normalize features, and split the data into training and testing sets.

## Notebook Structure
The Jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb is structured as follows:

## Introduction:

Overview of the KNN algorithm, including its advantages, limitations, and applications in classification and regression.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing:

1. Loading the datasets.
2. Preprocessing steps including handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## KNN Classifier Implementation:

1. Implementation of the KNN classifier using scikit-learn.
2. Hyperparameter tuning using grid search to find the optimal number of neighbors (k).
3. Evaluation of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

## KNN Regressor Implementation:

1. Implementation of the KNN regressor using scikit-learn.
2. Hyperparameter tuning to determine the best k for regression.
3. Evaluation of the regressor using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared score.

## Comparison with Other Models:

Comparison of KNN's performance with other machine learning models like Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Linear Regression for both classification and regression tasks.

## Results and Discussion:

1. Visualization of the results using various plots and graphs.
2. Discussion on how different values of k impact model performance.
3. Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of KNN in different scenarios.

## Conclusion:

1. Summary of key findings.
2. Recommendations for applying KNN in real-world applications.
